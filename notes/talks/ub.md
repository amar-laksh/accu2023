- One of the goals should be to make `UB` ill-formed.

# Different categories.
- `UB`
- Unspecified Behavior
- Implementation-defined behavior: Think about IO!
- Ill-formed: Think about this one!
- Ill-formed No diagnostic required: The compiler is not required to produce an executable. (This is a stricter version of `UB`)

## Undefined behavior
- If `UB` not inevitable, then compilers aren't really allowed to time travel/change the flow of the program.
