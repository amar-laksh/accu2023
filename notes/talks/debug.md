- ASIDE: What's the origins of section names? (`.text?`)
- dynamic relocations, PLT how does these two really work?
- `addr2line` (could be really useful) pipe it from `strace`, and then you have a nice `backtrace` with lines numbers.
- (read only > zero initialized) `.rodata` > `.bss`
- Add split dwarf instead of just `-g` for lesser time and space.
- `debuginfod` should be really useful.
- Look up `Call frame instructions`
- `.eh_frame` && `.debug_frame` does the `backtrace` now.
