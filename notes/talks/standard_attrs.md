## Attributes
- Use deprecated attribute more often. (could be used in class declarations)
- Use pure more often in functions.
- `[[maybe_unsued]]` could be really useful for functions parameters not being used as well.
- Try to use attributes as documentation as well. (e.g. `[[fallthrough]]` usage)
- use `[[nodiscard]]` with string literal message (C++20).
- Look up p600 (Nico's paper) for recommendations on `[[nodiscard]]` usage.
